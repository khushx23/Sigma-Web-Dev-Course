## What is CSS?
CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the visual presentation of a web page written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).

HTML creates the structure of the page, while CSS adds styling to that structure.

## Key Features of CSS:
- Styles and layouts of web pages.
- Works alongside HTML and XML documents.
- Enables responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Supports interactive effects like hover states and animations.
- CSS is now modularized, with ongoing updates rather than version numbers.
- Allows reusability of the same rules across multiple HTML documents.
