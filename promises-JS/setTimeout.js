// the setTimeout function in JavaScript is used to run some code after a delay.
// It takes two arguments: a function to run and a delay in milliseconds.
// setTimeout(function, delayInMilliseconds);
// function: the code you want to run (can be a function or arrow function).

// delayInMilliseconds: how long to wait before running the code, measured in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 second).
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Hello after 2 seconds');
  }, 2000); // 2000 milliseconds = 2 seconds

// The setTimeout function is asynchronous, meaning it doesn't block the rest of the code from running while waiting for the delay to finish.
// This means that the code after the setTimeout function will run immediately, without waiting for the delay to finish.
// For example:
console.log('This will run immediately, before the timeout finishes.');
// This will print "This will run immediately, before the timeout finishes." to the console immediately, without waiting for the 2 seconds delay in the setTimeout function.
// After 2 seconds, the message "Hello after 2 seconds" will be printed to the console.
