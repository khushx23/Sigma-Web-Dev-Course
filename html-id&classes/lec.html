<!-- In CSS, elements with IDs are selected using a hash (#) symbol before the ID, and elements with classes are selected using a dot (.) before the class name. -->

<!-- Uniqueness: IDs are unique, and classes can be reused.
JavaScript: IDs are often used for JavaScript operations.
Styling: Both can be used for styling, but IDs have higher specificity. -->
