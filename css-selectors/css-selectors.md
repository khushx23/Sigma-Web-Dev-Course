## What are CSS Selectors?
CSS selectors allow us to choose specific elements and apply styles to them. Suppose we want to add a custom style to only a specific tag(s). There, We can make use of CSS selector. 

There are different types of CSS selectors, which are as follows:

- Universal Selector
- Element Selector
- Id Selector
- Class Selector
- Group Selector
Let's look into these selectors one by one

### Element Selector (Type Selector)
The element selector selects the target element based on the specific type. Suppose you want to underline all the <p> tags; in this case, the element selector will be the best choice.

### ID Selector
The ID selector targets the elements based on the specific ID. It is written with the hash “#” character followed by the ID name in the style sheet.

### Class Selector
The class selector does the same job as the id selector, a class selector helps group various types of elements. Suppose, we want to give a custom style to a specific group of elements. In this case, the class selector is the best option.

It is written with the period “.” character followed by the class name in the style sheet.

### Group Selector
The group selector is used to minimise the code. Commas "," are used to separate each selector in a grouping. This reduces the number of lines of code. The code also looks clean.

## Summary:
Universal Selector(*): Target the entire page.
Element Selector: Target a specific element.
ID Selector(#): Target element with a specific ID.
Class Selector(.): Target element(s) with the same class.
Group Selector: Group elements and target them.
