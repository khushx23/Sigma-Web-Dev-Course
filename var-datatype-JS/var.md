Variable Naming Rules
There are a few rules that you need to follow when naming variables in JavaScript:

Variable names can only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Variable names cannot start with a digit.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
It is also a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful names for your variables, as this makes your code easier to read and understand.
